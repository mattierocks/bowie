    <h1>Career Summary</h1>
    <p>Ziggy played guitar,
      <br>jamming good with Weird
      <br>and Gilly, and the spiders
      <br>from Mars.</p>
    <p>Ziggy Stardust, a.k.a David
      <br>Bowie, a.k.a. David Jones
      <br> was born January 8, 1947.
      <br>He lived to change rock history.
      <br>David Bowie walked away
      <br> from music trends just as
      <br> fast as he could create them. His ability to evolve and change with the ever changing world kept him near the top
      of the charts his entire musical career.</p>
    <p>If you're older than five years old, and you're not a fan of David Bowie, than I don't know what to say... You're like
      a person who has never tried Ice cream or something. I feel sorry for you.</p>
