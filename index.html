	<h1>Career Summary</h1>
	<p>Ziggy played guitar, <br>jamming good with Weird <br>and Gilly, and the spiders <br>from Mars.</p>  
	<p>Ziggy Stardust, a.k.a David <br>Bowie, a.k.a. David Jones<br> was born January 8, 1947.  <br>He lived to change rock history.  <br>David Bowie walked away<br> from music trends just as<br> fast as he could create them.  His ability to evolve and change with the ever changing world kept him near the top of the charts his entire musical career.</p>
	<p>If you're older than five years old, and you're not a fan of David Bowie, than I don't know what to say... You're like a person who has never tried Ice cream or something.  I feel sorry for you.</p>
